              <p class="review__text">
                One Piece’s reputation precedes it. Setting a Guinness World
                Record for the most copies published for the same comic book
                series by a single author, it’s been in near-constant
                serialization for over 15 years and shows no signs of slowing
                down anytime soon. One Piece is a Japanese shonen manga, an
                action-oriented fantasy following in the footsteps of renowned
                titles like Dragon Ball. Yet, in terms of longevity, One Piece
                stands head and shoulders above its influences and
                contemporaries . So, what makes One Piece special?

                Story Structure – A Grand Odyssey
              </h3>
              <p class="review__text">
                One Piece is a simple story about a treasure hunt. The story
                follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a happy-go-lucky boy
                harbouring the powers of a “Devil Fruit” that turned his body
                into rubber. He sets sail for the Grand Line (a colossal
                planet-spanning sea) in search of the fabled treasure known only
                as “One Piece”. What follows is a massive island hopping
                adventure– which allows Luffy to slowly assemble an equally
                ambitious crew, battle rival pirates, and fight off Marines
                (operatives of an oppressive World Government bent on stamping
                out piracy). <br /><br />Each island has a distinct geography,
                social structure and position in the interconnected network of
                the Grand Line: some are occupied by Marines, others are
                independent kingdoms, and still more are uncharted territory.
                The surprisingly intricate geopolitical landscape allows for a
                wide variety of plot threads; Marine bases can be invaded by our
                heroes to rescue comrades, while alliances can be forged with
                neutral kingdoms to quell rebellions. The consequences of these
                varied story arcs form a constantly evolving world that exists
                independently of our heroes. <br /><br />The versatility of this
                setting works wonders for a long-running action comic by
                preventing narrative stagnation and providing a constant sense
                of progression. Sailing to the next island is always accompanied
                by anticipation for a new story-line and new ideas, and it’s
                always a tangible step closer to the crew’s ultimate goals. One
                Piece, therefore, is one of the few shonen manga that justifies
                its length. The journey’s grand scale is complemented by the
                story’s length, novel ideas are explored at each island and the
                overarching narrative maintains a steady momentum towards a
                definite, inevitable finish line.

                Artwork – Humour and Worldbuilding
              </h3>
              <p class="review__text">
                Eiichiro’s Oda distinctive artwork is the most immediately
                noticeable aspect of the comic. Faces and bodies have
                exaggerated proportions, often contorting to convey strong
                emotions or pull off inhuman martial arts feats. And the designs
                of characters themselves walk a fine line between the
                traditionally cool and hilariously goofy: where else can you
                find a megalomaniac king/mafia swathed in flamingo feathers, a
                cyborg sporting a pompadour, or a government assassin who morphs
                into a cuboid giraffe? This isn’t surface level novelty either,
                as character designs are often visual indicators for a
                character’s colorful personality or superhuman martial
                abilities. For instance, the aforementioned cyborg can detach
                his sideburns to use as projectiles in combat. <br /><br />This
                design philosophy carries over to the world itself. We’ve seen
                islands on the back of ancient elephants, islands made of giant
                pastries, islands housed in undersea bubbles, etc. However,
                worldbuilding is never sacrificed for the sake of novelty or a
                cheap laugh. Geographical features pose challenges for our
                heroes, like using a freakin’ boat to reach an island in the
                clouds, or play into the aforementioned social structures and
                global political landscape. This attention to detail ensures
                that the world feels cohesive and lived-in despite its
                absurdity.

                Characterization – Friendship and Ambition
              </h3>
              <p class="review__text">
                Beyond the wonders of adventure, One Piece heavily focuses on
                camaraderie and platonic relationships. The concept of building
                a crew remains integral to the story progression and the
                characters. Crew members are handpicked by Luffy and, through
                the course of the journey, have their motivations and
                personalities thoroughly explored (often through flashback
                sequences). <br /><br />
                Roronoa Zoro is a prime example of this approach to
                characterization. An ex-bounty hunter, Zoro is bent on becoming
                the greatest swordsman in the world. He’s the first person to
                join Luffy’s crew and is initially skeptical of the fledgling
                captain. However, Zoro soon gains real respect for Luffy’s wild
                ambition (as it mirrors his own), and becomes his most ardent
                supporter, despite being qualified to be a leader in his own
                right. While Zoro’s loyalty demonstrates his own growth, it also
                highlights Luffy’s leadership capabilities. When the going gets
                tough, even the fun-loving Luffy gets serious and takes up the
                captain’s mantle. <br /><br />This type of development has been
                afforded to all ten members of the crew so far, and forms a
                believable bond between all of them. Beyond an innate desire to
                see new islands and characters, it’s this friendship that drives
                the story forward. This isn’t a story about chosen ones on a
                quest to save the world, it’s a story about misfits and weirdos
                chasing their unrealistic, foolish dreams. Friendship ties the
                weird, disparate elements of the story’s world together. No
                matter where we go in One Piece, we’ll do it as a crew.

                In Conclusion
              </h3>
              <p class="review__text">
                At the end of the day, One Piece isn’t an infallible comic. Not
                every arc is a winner, some characters aren’t especially deep,
                and the humour isn’t for everyone. But it’s worth examining the
                properties that make it unique, as these same properties have
                cemented it as one of the longest-lived stories of our time, a
                true epic in the making. One Piece’s strengths reveal themselves
                as the world unfolds, and it’s a lot of fun to be along for the
                cruise.
